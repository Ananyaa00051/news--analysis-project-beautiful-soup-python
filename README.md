# 📰 News Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

The **News Analysis Project** is a Python-based Jupyter Notebook that analyzes news articles to extract insights, trends, and sentiment. The project demonstrates data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques, making it a great example of applied **Data Science and Natural Language Processing (NLP).**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Web scraping & data collection of news content
* Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal)
* Sentiment analysis of news articles
* Word frequency & keyword extraction
* Data visualization (word clouds, graphs, trends)
* Insights into how media portrays specific topics
